                <p>Thursday marks the 50th wedding anniversary for Blair and Jackie Winward of Soda Springs. They were
                    married in 1971 in the Logan, Utah temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Jackie
                    grew up in Enterprise, Utah and Henderson, Nevada and received an associate's degree from Dixie Jr
                    College in St. George, Utah before attending Utah State University.Blair grew up in Dayton, Idaho on
                    a small dairy farm, attended USU where the two met and both graduated. They have lived in Coalville,
                    Utah, Montpelier and for the last 46 years, in Soda Springs.

                    Jackie taught family and consumer sciences (home economics) in Coalville, Utah for two years, then
                    dedicated her life to the raising of her family and resumed teaching part-time in Bancroft, Idaho
                    for 13 years before retirement. She was an adviser for Family Career Community Leaders of America,
                    served on the state board of Idaho Association of Teachers of Family & Consumer Sciences as District
                    5 representative, district director and state treasurer.She received the Beyond the Classroom award
                    in 2010 and was chosen as state Teacher of the Year in 2013 for IATFCS. She owned and taught
                    childrenâ€™s singing and performing groups (a Talent Sprout franchise and her own Noteables and NOYS);
                    a chocolate candy-making business was among other home-based businesses.

                    Jackie is noted for her sewing skills, which resulted in beautiful prom and wedding dresses for her
                    daughters, as well as others. She taught sewing skills to numerous youth in 4-H. Known for her
                    beautiful soprano voice, she has shared that gift freely in many venues and taught private vocal
                    lessons to many. She also shares her love and talent for music by volunteering in the community
                    Christmas concerts, both choir and orchestra (French horn), and has participated in numerous summer
                    musicals.

                    Blair spent his career of nearly 40 years in materials handling at Agrium (now Itafos), a phosphate
                    plant in Conda, Idaho, most of that time in procurement. He was a long-time member, vice president
                    and president of the Institute of Supply Management Association for Eastern Idaho.

                    Ever interested in helping youth, Blair has served in numerous Scouting positions, mentoring many
                    Scouts to achieve the rank of Eagle. An Eagle Scout himself, he has received the So. Caribou
                    District Award of Merit, the Silver Beaver and the National Outstanding Eagle Scout award.</p>
