        <h2>Weather Site Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            The intended audience is casual and serious athletes who run, walk, bicycle, or otherwise exercise outdoors.
            Also elementary teachers
            who teach students about daily weather changes, and plan field trips and excursions out of the classroom.
            Likely cell phone users on the go. These personas include singles people as well as people with families. It
            is aimed at middle class users, with higher education, as typically higher earners are often better able
            to find leisure exercise time, and teachers that have higher education as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Weather Site Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When should I plan my run for the morning? When will the sun be up and the temperature be comfortable?
            </li>
            <li> Will it rain tomorrow? When? When is the best time of day for my bike ride?</li>
            <li>When will the sun be setting tomorrow? Will I be headed into it or away from it on my run? Do I need my
                sunglasses?</li>
            <li>What day this weekend should I do my marathon training? Which day has the best weather for it?</li>



            <li>When should I plan this fieldtrip? Will there be rain?</li>
            <li>What weather conditions should I teach my students about tomorrow? What will we see when we look
                outside?</li>
            <li>Will my class be able to have recess today or will they need activities in the classroom due to cold or
                rain/snow?</li>
        </ul>
